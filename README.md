# PowerBI-Projects
The projects I have worked on to improve my skills in Power BI

1) HR Data Analytics - Helped me a lot to learn different tools in Power BI as a beginner
 - This project was done using real data of AtliQ company.
 - Designed a dashboard to track employee data for the HR Team, including working hours, attendance, 
performance and leaves. The dashboard was helpful in increasing the efficiency and logistics and to save operational costs as well.
